# VSMod-DoffAndDonAgain
## Latest Update
- v1.16 compatible.
- *Don* will 'equip' tools from armor stands based on configurable rules.

## Description
Out spelunking and need to patch up your wounds but you're wearing full plate? *Doff* it! Drop all that armor at the touch of a button (or two, default: Ctrl + U).

Back at base and want to get comfortable quickly? Target an armor stand and *Doff*! Any equipped armor that can be placed on the armor stand will be.

Woke up to a temporal storm in the middle off the night and you forgot to wear protection to bed? Run to your armor stand and *Don* your armor! All armor from the stand will be equipped to any empty armor slots you have (default: U).

There's also *Swap*! Exchange your equipped armor with an armor stand's. (default: Shift + U)

*Doff and Don Again* is configurable to suit your playstyle, disable specific actions, adjust saturation costs, number of free hands required to act, etc.
