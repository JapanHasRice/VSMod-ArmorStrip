# VSMod-DoffAndDonAgain
Out spelunking and need to patch up your wounds but you're wearing full plate? *Doff* it! Drop all that armor at the touch of a button (or two, default: Ctrl + U).

Back at base and want to get comfortable quickly? Target an armor stand and *Doff*! Any armor that can be placed on the armor stand will be.

Woke up to a temporal storm in the middle off the night and you forgot to wear protection to bed? Run to your armor stand and *Don* your armor! All armor from the stand will be equipped to any empty armor slots you have (default: U).
